<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold">Project Description</h2>

A free platform for gamers to explore the **indie gaming community**, discussion, promotion by/for developers and players. To spread word of mouth thereby reducing strain on the high budget of advertising. And we'll not be collecting any personal data of user/visitor. Big gaming companies uses their major funds in advertising by paying off the streamers to spread the word of mouth among their viewers and others, this platform would provide them with the same **help without the high budget requirement.**

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold" id="features">Platform Features</h2>

- **Create community for your games:** Create a profile for your game, with discussion forums, ratings, platforms available on, genre, system requirement and lots more.

- **Safe environment for dicussions:** We have implemented **profane language filters** to clean up bad language in the discussion forums.

- **Open for all:** Even if a person doesn't create a profile, they can **access the forums' content without the obligation of creating a profile**, he/she will have to create a profile only if they want to add to the content.

- **Promote your games:** We provide you the feature to **promote your game and its community** in various social media platforms **with just one click.**

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold">Core Values</h2>

1. Serve the community of **"small" known and unknown gaming communities** around the internet.
2. Help independent game developers to **create a community for their games.**

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold" id="contributing">Core Team & Inspiration</h2>

This project was initially developed by the following members for the [MLH Explorer Sprint 1](https://devpost.com/software/indie-threads?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress). The theme for the spirint was **gaming**. So, we thought of creating a free platform for indie game devs to promote and advertise their games without having to worry about a high budget requirement for promotions whilst providing a channel to the gamers to explore the indie-gaming community which would serve as discussion forums at the same time, indie-threads took its shape.
